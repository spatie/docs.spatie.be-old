title: Cleaning up old backups
---

Over time the amount of backups and the storage needed to keep them will grow. At some point you are going to want to clean up old backups.

You can clean up your backups by running:

```bash
php artisan backup:clean
```

We'll tell you right off the bat that the package by default will never delete the newest backup regardless of it's size or age.

## Determining which backups should be deleted

This is the portion of the configuration that will determine which backups should be deleted.

```php
//config/laravel-backup.php

    'cleanup' => [
        /*
         * The strategy that will be used to cleanup old backups. The default strategy
         * will keep all backups for a certain amount of days. After that period only
         * a daily backup will be kept. After that period only weekly backups will
         * be kept and so on.
         *
         * No matter how you configure it the default strategy will never
         * deleted the newest backup.
         */
        'strategy' => \Spatie\Backup\Tasks\Cleanup\Strategies\DefaultStrategy::class,

        'defaultStrategy' => [

            /*
             * The amount of days that all backups must be kept.
             */
            'keepAllBackupsForDays' => 7,

            /*
             * The amount of days that all daily backups must be kept.
             */
            'keepDailyBackupsForDays' => 16,

            /*
             * The amount of weeks of which one weekly backup must be kept.
             */
            'keepWeeklyBackupsForWeeks' => 8,

            /*
             * The amount of months of which one monthly backup must be kept.
             */
            'keepMonthlyBackupsForMonths' => 4,

            /*
             * The amount of years of which one yearly backup must be kept.
             */
            'keepYearlyBackupsForYears' => 2,

            /*
             * After cleaning up the backups remove the oldest backup until
             * this amount of megabytes has been reached.
             */
            'deleteOldestBackupsWhenUsingMoreMegabytesThan' => 5000,
        ],
    ],
```

This package provides an opinionated method to determine which old backups should be deleted. We call this the `DefaultStrategy`. This is how it works:

- Rule #1: it will never delete the newest backup regardless of it's size or age
- Rule #2: it will keep all backups for the amount of days specified in `keepAllBackupsForDays`
- Rule #3: it will only keep daily backups for the amount of days specified in `keepDailyBackupsForDays` for all backups
older than those that rule #2 takes care of
- Rule #4: it will only keep weekly backups for the amount of months specified in `keepMonthlyBackupsForMonths` for all backups older than those that rule #3 takes care of
- Rule #5: it will only keep yearly backups for the amount of years specified in `keepYearlyBackupsForYears` for all backups older than those that rule #4 takes care of
- Rule #6: it will start deleting old backups until the used storage is lower than the number specified in `deleteOldestBackupsWhenUsingMoreMegabytesThan`.

Of course, the numbers used in the default configuration can be adjusted to your own liking.

## Creating your own strategy

If you are not happy with the `DefaultStrategy`, you can create your own custom strategy. You can do so by extending the abstract class `Spatie\Backup\Tasks\Cleanup\CleanupStrategy`. You only need to implement this method:

```php
use Spatie\Backup\BackupDestination\BackupCollection;

public function deleteOldBackups(BackupCollection $backupCollection)
```

The `BackupCollection` class is extended from `Illuminate\Support\Collection` and contains `Spatie\Backup\BackupDestination\Backup` objects sorted by age. The newest backup is the first one in the collection.

Using the collection, you can easily manually delete the older backup:

```php
// Retrieve an instance of `Spatie\Backup\BackupDestination\Backup`
$backup = $backups->oldestBackup();

// Bye bye backup
$backup->delete();
```

Don't forget to specify the full classname of your custom strategy in the `cleanup.strategy` key of the `laravel-backup` config file.

## Getting notified when a cleanup goes wrong

You can receive a notification when a cleanup goes wrong. Read the section on [notifications]('/laravel-backup/v4/sending-notifications/overview) to know more.

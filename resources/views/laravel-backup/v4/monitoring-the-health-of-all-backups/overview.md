title: Monitoring the health of all backups
---

The package can check the health of every application it has been installed into. A backup is considered unhealthy if the date of the newest backup is too far in the past or if the storage needed for all backups is too large.

## Installation

We recommend setting up a separate Laravel installation, preferably on a separate server. Doing it this way will ensure you will still get notified of unhealthy backups even if one of the applications you are monitoring is broken.

To install the monitor follow the regular [installation instructions](/laravel-backup/v4/installation-and-setup).
Instead of scheduling the `backup:run` and `backup:clean` commands, you should schedule the monitor command.

```php
//app/Console/Kernel.php

protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
   $schedule->command('backup:monitor')->daily()->at('03:00');
}
```

You can of course still schedule `backup:run` and `backup:clean` to backup the monitoring application itself.

## Specifying which backups should be monitored

This is the part of the configuration where you can specify which applications should be monitored and when the monitor should consider the backups of a certain application unhealthy.

```php
//config/laravel-backup.php

    /*
     *  In this array you can specify which backups should be monitored.
     *  If a backup does not meet the specified requirements the
     *  UnHealthyBackupWasFound-event will be fired.
     */
    'monitorBackups' => [
        [
            'name' => env('APP_URL'),
            'disks' => ['local'],
            'newestBackupsShouldNotBeOlderThanDays' => 1,
            'storageUsedMayNotBeHigherThanMegabytes' => 5000,
        ],

        /*
        [
            'name' => 'name of the second app',
            'disks' => ['local', 's3'],
            'newestBackupsShouldNotBeOlderThanDays' => 1,
            'storageUsedMayNotBeHigherThanMegabytes' => 5000,
        ],
        */
    ],
```

The `name` of a monitor should match the value you have specified in the `backup.name` key of the config file in
the application that is being backed up.

If you set `storageUsedMayNotBeHigherThanMegabytes` to `0` then the monitor will consider that the backup can use unlimited storage.

## Getting notified of (un)healthy backups

You can receive notifications when the monitor finds an (un)healthy backup. 
Read the section on [notifications](/laravel-backup/v4/sending-notifications/overview) to know more.

## Seeing an overview of all backups

You can perform this command to see the status of all monitored destination filesystems.

```bash
php artisan backup:list
```

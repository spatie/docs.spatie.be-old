title: Backing up a non-laravel application
---

This package is tailor-made for use inside Laravel applications. But with a little bit of good will you can use it to backup non-Laravel applications as well.
 
To do so install Laravel on the same server where your non-Laravel application runs. In the Laravel app you'll have to install this package using the [installation instructions](/laravel-backup/v5/installation-and-setup). In the `app/config/backup.php`configuration file specify the paths of the non-laravel application you wish to backup in the `backup.source.files.include` key.

Do not forget to configure the database as well. In `app/config/databases.php` put the credentials of the database used by the non-Laravel application. 

When running `php artisan backup:run` on the command line, the application will be backed up.

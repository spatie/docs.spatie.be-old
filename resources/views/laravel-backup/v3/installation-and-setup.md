title: Installation and setup
---

## Basic installation

You can install this package via composer using:

``` bash
composer require "spatie/laravel-backup:^3.0.0"
```

You'll need to register the serviceprovider:

```php
// config/app.php

'providers' => [
    // ...
    Spatie\Backup\BackupServiceProvider::class,
];
```

To publish the config file to `config/laravel-backup.php` run:

``` bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Backup\BackupServiceProvider"
```

This is the default contents of the configuration:

```php
//config/laravel-backup.php

return [

    'backup' => [

        /*
         * The name of this application. You can use this name to monitor
         * the backups.

## Scheduling

After you have performed the basic installation you can start using the `backup:run`, `backup:clean`, `backup:list` and `backup:monitor`-commands. In most cases you'll want to schedule these commands so you don't have to manually run `backup:run` everytime you need a new backup.

The commands can, like an other command, be scheduled in Laravel's console kernel.

```php
// app/Console/Kernel.php

protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
   $schedule->command('backup:clean')->daily()->at('01:00');
   $schedule->command('backup:run')->daily()->at('02:00');
}
```

Of course, the hours used in the code above are just examples. Adjust them to your own preferences.

## Monitoring

When your application is broken the scheduled jobs will obviously not run anymore. You could also simply forget to add a cron job needed to trigger Laravel's scheduling. You think backups are being made but in fact
nothing gets backed up.

To notify you of such events the package contains monitoring functionality. It will inform you when backups become too old or when they take up too much storage.

Learn how to [set up monitoring](/laravel-backup/v3/monitoring-the-health-of-all-backups/overview).

## Dumping the database
`mysqldump` and `pg_dump` are used to dump the database. If they are not installed in a default location, you can add a key named `dump_command_path` in Laravel's own `database.php` config file. Be sure to only fill in the path to the binary without the name of the binary itself.

If your database dump takes a long time you might hit the default timeout of 60 seconds. You can set a higher (or lower) limit by providing a `dump_command_timeout` config key which sets how long the command may run in seconds.

Here's an example for MySQL:
```php
//config/databases.php
'connections' => [
	'mysql' => [
		'dump_command_path' => '/path/to/the/binary', // only the path, so without 'mysqldump' or 'pg_dump'
		'dump_command_timeout' => 60 * 5, // 5 minute timeout
		'dump_using_single_transaction' => true, // perform dump using a single transaction
		'driver'    => 'mysql',
		...
	],
```

For PostgreSQL db's you can also set a config key named `dump_use_inserts` to use `inserts` instead of `copy` in the database dump file.

title: Installation and setup
---

## Basic installation

You can install this package via composer using:

``` bash
composer require spatie/laravel-uptime-monitor
```

You'll need to register the service provider:

```php
// config/app.php

'providers' => [
    // ...
    Spatie\UptimeMonitor\UptimeMonitorServiceProvider::class,
];
```

To publish the config file to `config/laravel-uptime-monitor.php` run:

``` bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\UptimeMonitor\UptimeMonitorServiceProvider"
```

The default contents of the configuration looks like this:

```php
return [

    /*
     * You can get notified when specific events occur. Out of the box you can use 'mail'
     * and 'slack'. Of course you can also specify your own notification classes.
     */
    'notifications' => [

        'notifications' => [
            \Spatie\UptimeMonitor\Notifications\Notifications\MonitorFailed::class => ['slack'],

        /*

         */
        'concurrent_checks' => 10,

        /*

    'ssl-check' => [

         */
        'fire_expiring_soon_event_if_certificate_expires_within_days' => 10,
    ],

    /*

     */
     'monitor_model' => Spatie\UptimeMonitor\Models\Monitor::class,
];
```

## Scheduling

After you have performed the basic installation you can check the uptime and ssl certificates of sites using the `monitor:check-uptime` and `monitor:check-ssl` commands. In most cases you'll want to schedule them. We recommend that you run the uptime check every minute and the ssl certificate check daily. 

You can schedule the commands, like any other command, in the console Kernel.

```php
// app/Console/Kernel.php

protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
   $schedule->command('monitor:check-uptime')->everyMinute();
   $schedule->command('monitor:check-ssl')->daily();
}
```

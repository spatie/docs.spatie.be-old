This package can monitor the validity of ssl certificates. It can notify you when an invalid certificate is found. It can also warn you if a certificate is going to expire soon.

To get started you should [create a monitor](https://docs.spatie.be/laravel-uptime-monitor/v1/monitoring-uptime/getting-started#creating-your-first-monitor). Toke make life easy for you, if the url starts with `https://` the package will automatically enable a certificate check.
